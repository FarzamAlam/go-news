# Go-News
> [Go-News](https://go-find-news.herokuapp.com/) is Minimalistic News Website that tells you about *only* what you want to know.

People are always bombarded with news that are not relevant to them. This creates lots of distraction. So what Go-News does is, it lets you know news that you care about.

It is designed to be very minimalistic with only things that are necessary. It searches News basis what you type among multiple sources and shows you the relevant information.

`Note: This is a simple go project in which I have explored web handlers, middleware and caching.`
